		There will be several homeworks throughout the
		quarter, based on the material covered in class
		(typically one per major topic).  You can access them through Canvas by clicking on the relevant link in the <a href = "schedule.html">schedule</a> page (or navigating to the appropriate Quiz in Canvas).
            <br><br>
            Please note: <b> Even though they are administered through the Canvas "Quiz" section, they are in fact homeworks and not quizzes.</b>
            <br><br>
            These are due after we have covered the material in class, and are available while we cover the topic so you can be working on them as we discuss the relevant material in class.
            <font color = "#60c"><b>Each homework assignment must be submitted through Canvas by the end of class (12:50pm) the day it is due for full credit,

            <b>Late policy</b>: Late assignments will be accepted, but will lose 5% of the total score possible on the assignment for <font color="#60c"><b>every day</b></font> late.  This is to encourage you to do the assignments, as it is far preferable to work through the material late rather than never. Moreover, homework comprises a significant portion of your grade, so please do it - even if it's late.  Late assignments can be submitted through the normal Canvas interface.

            <center><h2 id = "commenting">Commenting on Course Material</h2></center>
		<p>
		Discussing material from class is one way to engage with it more productively.
            We'll use interactive commenting where you can respond to other people's comments and
            engage in a discussion over the content.
            <br><br>
            Note: Even just seeing other people's comments on content you also had thoughts about
            can help refine your own understanding of that content. That's why we’ll be doing
            <b><font color = "#9900ff">interactive commenting</font></b> for each unit’s review questions and homework questions.
<br><br>
<div class="comment">
            We'll currently be using Perusall (linked through the Canvas coursesite) as a tool for interactive commenting.
            You'll be responsible for generating comments (either directly on the content or in response to others' comments)
            for course material in the unit.<br><br>
            We'll use these comments to guide our in-class discussion for each review session,
    so you can <b>only receive full credit if you comment by the review session start</b>.
    <br><br>

Late interactive commenting will be accepted for partial credit,
            according to Persuall's "linearly-declining" credit rubric.
            (So, the later you submit after the deadline, the less credit you get.)

    <div class="contents">
            <center><h2 id = "reviewsessions">Review Sessions</h2></center>
		<p>
		If a class session is labeled as "review session", this means that the following will occur:<br>
<ul>
<li>The in-class review session is intended for us to go over comments made via Perusall for the course material for that review session.
    We may also take questions that are asked live.
<li>This means you should review the lecture notes, associated podcasts, review questions, and homework questions
    for that topic before you attend the review session, in order to get the most out of the review.
</ul>

		</div>


<div class="contents">
  <center><h2 id = "exams">Timed Assessments</h2></center>
  <p>
There will be a timed assessment after almost every major topic
  covered (though the last one combines two topics because they’re
  short). These assessments are <font color = "#80f">not
  cumulative</font>, and include only material from that topic,
  typically 3-5 lectures worth of material. <br><br>

  Review questions will be available for each topic covered in class,
  and there will be a discussion/review in class before each timed
  assessment opens up.
You are <font color = "#80f">not required to do review questions, but they're
  helpful study guides</font>.

<div class= "comment">
  <b>The timed assessments are open-note</b> (including the
  lecture notes, the homeworks, the review sessions, the reference materials, AI, and any notes of your own you wish to have), but they
  are <b><i>non-collaborative</i></b> (no group efforts, please).   If
  you are caught collaborating during any timed assessment, you will
  all receive a 0 for that timed assessment and be reported for
  academic dishonesty.  <br><br>

<!-- You are <font color = "#80f">allowed to take each timed assessment twice, and keep the higher of the two scores</font>. -->

 There will no makeup for the timed assessments unless you have an
 emergency (family, medical, etc.) for the entire window during
 which the timed assessment can be taken. If that occurs, you should
 contact the professor as soon as possible afterwards and make
 arrangements.  A doctor's note or some other form of "proof of
 emergency" will be expected in that situation. <b>If you know ahead
 of time that you can't take the timed assessment during its
 designated window, you should contact the professor <font color="#00f">beforehand</font></b> to make arrangements to take it at some other time.</b><br><br>


All timed assessments will be given as online Quizzes through Canvas.
  This means that you will only be able to access the timed assessment
  during the appointed window (typically 2-3 days) using a device that
  has internet connectivity.<br><br>

    <b>You can take the timed assessment anywhere you have access to a
    device with internet connectivity.</b> However, if you experience
    any technical difficulties, please contact the professor
    as soon as possible (don't wait till after the timed assessment
    window is over).<br><br>

  <center><h2 id = "extra_credit">Extra credit</h2></center>
  <p>
You may earn up to a <font color = "#0000ff">maximum of 3 extra credit percentage points </font> two different ways:
  <br><br>

(1) <b><font color = "#aa0099">You can participate in social science laboratory experiments.</font></b>
<br>
      You may earn extra credit by participating in experimental research through the Social Ecology Human Subjects Lab.
      Participation in research is completely voluntary; there may be alternative ways to accrue extra credit for this course (see below).
      It is your responsibility to read through the policies on the <a href = "https://sites.uci.edu/hslab/student-info/" target="_blank">HS Lab Student Participation Page</a>
      and note the deadlines listed on the SONA login page.

      <br><br>
      <font color = "#0000ff">To participate in research</font>, login to <a href = "https://uci.sona-systems.com/" target="_blank">SONA</a> and view the list of available studies.
      Studies are listed randomly and change throughout the quarter as they become available.
      <br><br>
      If you agree to participate in an experiment, you form a contract with the researcher to be present at the assigned time and designated place.
      If you accrue 2 unexcused no-shows, your account will be limited and you will not be able to sign up for additional studies for the remainder of the quarter.
      <br><br>
      You will earn 1 SONA credit for each hour of research participation.  For example, 1 hour of research participation = 1 SONA credit.
      <font color = "#0000ff">You may assign a total of 3 SONA credits to this course</font>.  You must allocate each credit earned to the course(s) of your choice.
      <br><br>
      This course is listed in SONA as <font color = "#0000ff">[to be filled in]</font>.
      <br><br>
      It is your responsibility to check your credit assignments before the stated deadlines on the SONA login page,
      as accounts will be disabled and no changes, extensions, or exceptions will be made.
      No credit will be given if a student does not properly allocate his or her credit.

    <ul>
    <li> You must accurately reference where in the course the content comes from (e.g., Lecture 3, slide 10; HW 1 question 6a). The grader can “fact-check” any of these references.
<li>You must say which AI tool you used, show the response the AI tool gave, and explain why the AI’s response is wrong. The grader can “fact-check” whether the AI tool you list gets the question wrong.
<li>The question can be any format you want (e.g., true/false, short answer, fill-in-the-blank)

    <div class="comment">
        Note on how extra credit affects your final grade: You'll start the quarter with 0 out of 3 points in extra credit.
        Because the other components of your grade add up to 100%, the extra credit is 3% on top of that.
        However, before you've completed at least one assignment in each category,
        it'll look like that 0 out of 3 is hurting you.
        This is because of the way Canvas calculates your grades when you don't have any entries in a category.
        So, if you look at how that 0 out of 3 is affecting your grade before you complete at least one HW,
        one Perusall commenting, and at least one timed assessment, you'll think it's lowering your grade.
<br><br>
It really, truly won't. So, don't worry about it till then. And do complete the extra credit if you can, because it can help!
<br><br>
        <font color = "#5500ff"><b>TL;DR version: Don't pay any attention to the extra credit score until after you've completed at least one assignment in each category.</b></font>
