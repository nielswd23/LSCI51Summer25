Language is an incredibly complex system of knowledge.  Not only are
		  there multiple levels of representation - sounds and
		  words and phrases and whole utterances and meanings - but within a given level, even simple forms can be derived from multiple interacting pieces of knowledge.  Yet as speakers of any given language, we are often blissfully unaware of how much we need to know in order to be able to communicate with language.<br><br>

		  One of the most striking things about language is that all typically-developing children learn their native language flawlessly, especially when compared to adults trying to accomplish the same task.  This is true despite adults' superior cognitive skills. Children of the world seem somehow suited for language acquisition in a way that adult humans - and other animals - are not.  <br><br>
		  In this class, we survey the broad topic of language acquisition, focusing not only on children's developmental trajectory, but also on what knowledge of language is, how language acquisition relates to cognition in general, and acquisition of language by speakers with sensory or cognitive deficits.  Topics include the biological basis of language, levels of linguistic knowledge, language and cognition, and language in special populations.
<br><br>

<b>This course counts as a category III GE course.</b> After completing this course, successful students will be able to do the following:<br>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the
		  theories, sources, and interpretations of human
		  language acquisition behavior at the individual
		    level.
		    <li>Demonstrate an understanding of contemporary and historical perspectives on human language acquisition behavior.
		    <li>Understand and explain the
		  scientific/interpretive methods used in (i) the
		  acquisition of knowledge about human language
		  learning behavior and (ii) the testing of competing
		    theories about human language acquisition.
		    <li>Critically evaluate methods, findings, and conclusions in the research literature on human language acquisition behavior.
		    </ul>
